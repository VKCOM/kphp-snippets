# Libraries written in PHP aimed to be compiled with KPHP

This repository contains snippets and libraries of KPHP-compatible code.

You can use this repo 
* for learning, how KPHP-compatible code looks like
* for using some of this code in your project (in a copy-paste manner)

Each library has its own *README* with detailed instructions:
* [Protobuf](Protobuf) — encode/decode data to Protobuf binary format and back, based on .proto scheme
* [Grpc](Grpc) — send Protobuf encoded data via gRPC and parse received bytes
* [minutiae](minutiae) — various single-file PHP snippets

Feel free to examine this code and to contribute if you got something to share.
